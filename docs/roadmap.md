# 🛣 **Roll for Language Backend Implementation Roadmap**

> *“We build not for today, but for tomorrow and beyond.”*

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Core Complete)**

**Goal:** Ensure the backend has all critical building blocks for a stable MVP.

* [x] Finalize Fastify server scaffolding (plugins, routes, controllers)
* [ ] Lock in JWT auth (access + refresh tokens)
* [x] Set up Drizzle ORM with PlanetScale, schemas, migrations
* [ ] Integrate Socket.IO basic real-time events
* [ ] Confirm .env management and secrets handling
* [ ] Document core API endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI

---

### 🛡 **Phase 2: Hardening & Safeguards (Should-Have Layer)**

**Goal:** Strengthen the system’s security, reliability, and maintainability.

* [ ] Add Fastify rate limiter and anti-abuse protections
* [ ] Build fine-grained RBAC or ABAC permission checks
* [ ] Integrate in-memory or Redis session management
* [ ] Expand test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
* [ ] Establish audit logging for sensitive operations
* [ ] Scaffold internationalization-ready backend (prep for Strapi)
* [ ] Implement file/media service with Backblaze B2 (or similar)

---

### 🚀 **Phase 3: Feature Expansion (Would-Be-Nice Layer)**

**Goal:** Unlock advanced backend powers for game mechanics and future scaling.

* [ ] Design modular RPG mechanics engine (stat rolls, checks, modifiers)
* [ ] Prepare backend hooks for Strapi or CMS content ingestion
* [ ] Integrate Redis adapter for Socket.IO clustering/scaling
* [ ] Explore API gateway or reverse proxy setup (for routing/load balancing)
* [ ] Architect plugin/expansion system for future game modules
* [ ] Add search indexing (ElasticSearch, Typesense) for deep search

---

### 🔧 **Phase 4: Supporting Tools & Automation**

**Goal:** Ensure developer and operations health over the long term.

* [ ] Automate migrations/seeds in CI/CD workflows
* [ ] Integrate New Relic or APM for backend performance tracking
* [ ] Auto-generate API documentation (Swagger) and maintain dev wiki/onboarding guides
* [ ] Build backup and recovery automation

---

### 🏗 **Phase 5: Infrastructure & DevOps**

**Goal:** Create rock-solid deployment and monitoring pipelines.

* [ ] Build CI/CD pipelines for Railway with linting, tests, deploy steps
* [ ] Dockerize backend for consistent local + prod environments (optional)
* [ ] Define `.env` templates and secrets management for all environments
